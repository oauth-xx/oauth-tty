A TTY Command Line Interface for interacting with OAuth 1.0 services.

This library was written originally by [Thiago Pinto](https://github.com/thiagopintodev) in 2016 and bundled with the oauth gem.
It was extracted into a separate library by [Peter Boling](https://railsbling.com) in 2022 as part of the move to a stable version 1.0 for the oauth gem.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add oauth-tty

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install oauth-tty

NOTE: You might see a warning like:
```
oauth-tty's executable "oauth" conflicts with oauth
Overwrite the executable? [yN]  y
```
The `oauth` executable from this gem *is* the extracted and repackaged executable from the `oauth` gem, so you *should* overwrite it.

## Usage

In a shell run `oauth` to start the console.

For now, please see the tests for other usage.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the OAuth::TTY project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://gitlab.com/oauth-xx/oauth-tty/-/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## ðŸ¤‘ One more thing

You made it to the bottom of the page,
so perhaps you'll indulge me for another 20 seconds.
I maintain many dozens of gems, including this one,
because I want Ruby to be a great place for people to solve problems, big and small.
Please consider supporting my efforts via the giant yellow link below,
or one of the others at the head of this README.
